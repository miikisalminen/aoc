# Advent of Code

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I have not designed any of these problems, these are only my solutions.

All credit goes to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), thank you for creating and upkeeping this project all these years.
